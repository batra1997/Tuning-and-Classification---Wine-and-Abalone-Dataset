# Tuning-and-Classification-Wine-and-Abalone-Dataset

The [Wine Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) consists of one data for red wine and one data for white wine. The provided jupyter notebook loads the data and adds an additional column for wine color where color = 0 indicates white wine and color = 1 indicates red wine.<br>
The second dataset is the [Abalone dataset](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone) about the abalone fishes and it's physical characteristics. The aim of this project was to predict `Rings` from the other features and this feature is essentially the age of the fish.
